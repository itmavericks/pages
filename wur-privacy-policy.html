    <h1>Would You Rather - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: July 30, 2025</p>

    <p>Would You Rather ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Would You Rather mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our App and the choices you have associated with that information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Would You Rather App does not collect, store, or share any personal information (e.g., name, email address, or other personally identifiable data). We may collect the following non-personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>: Anonymous usage data, such as device type, operating system, IP address, or app interactions, to improve the App’s functionality and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>No Data Collection</strong>: If no data is collected, we explicitly state: "This App does not collect, store, or share any personal or non-personal information."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use non-personal information, if collected, for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the App's functionality.</li>
        <li>To analyze usage patterns and improve the App’s user experience.</li>
        <li>To respond to user inquiries or support requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share any personal information, as we do not collect it. Non-personal information may be shared with third-party service providers (e.g., analytics providers) to perform services on our behalf, under strict confidentiality agreements, or when required by law.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Any non-personal data collected is stored securely using industry-standard measures. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Data Rights</h2>
    <p>As we do not collect personal information, data rights such as access, deletion, or correction are not applicable. If you have questions about data practices, contact us at the email below.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services, such as Google Analytics or AdMob, which collect data as described in their privacy policies. If applicable, links to their policies are provided below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If no third-party services are used, we state: "This App does not use third-party services that collect user data."</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Would You Rather App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Please review this policy periodically.</p>
